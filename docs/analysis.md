# Dunn Marketing - Website Analysis

**Current Site:** https://dunnmarketing.com
**Analysis Date:** February 5, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Dunn Marketing has strong brand positioning, award-winning work, and compelling client results. However, the current website doesn't reflect the quality of work the agency produces. The site runs on dated infrastructure, has significant SEO gaps, and misses opportunities to convert visitors into leads.

**Recommendation:** Full website redesign with modern architecture, conversion-focused UX, and robust SEO foundation.

**2. Layout Problems**
- Dense homepage with too many sections

**3. Copy Issues**

### UX Friction Points

3. **No live chat** or scheduling tool
4. **Work portfolio** requires clicking through carousel
5. **No search results page** optimization
6. **Cookie consent** is detailed but overwhelming
